> A consistent style makes code easier to read, debug, and helps catch errors. It takes a team of 100 programmers to come together and write the next big application, yet it should look as if one person coded it. With the aid of linters, code can be programmatically checked for adherence to a convention. Making everyone's work easy to mesh together into one cohesive source of truth.

## About

Shareable configs <sup id="anchor-2">[2](#sharable-configs-note)</sup> alter or extend the base rules of ESLint.<sup id="anchor-3">[3](#eslint-note)</sup> Making it easy to distribute a styling convention among developers. The [Armirage JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/armirage/eslint-config-armirage/blob/master/docs/javascript-style-guide.md) has more details on the linting rules we apply and why.

## Install

Open open a terminal in, or change directory to, your working directory. This should be the project folder with NPM's `package.json` in it.

To install ESLint and Armirage sharable config, run the following commands in the terminal:

```console
npm install eslint @armirage/eslint-config-armirage --save-dev
```
* :pencil: NOTE: The sharable config is a scoped npm package and will need to be referenced that way.

This will save both as developer dependencies. Linters are development tools and unnecessary in production builds.

While in the terminal, create the configuration file `.eslintrc.json`

```console
touch .eslintrc.json
```
* :pencil: NOTE: The `.eslintrc.json` begins with a period. This is a hidden file on many systems. To see it, enable 'show hidden files' for your OS.

To complete installation See [Usage](#usage).

## Usage

Once the eslint-config-armirage package is installed, you can activate the rules in the ESLint configuration file.

// .eslintrc.json
```json
{
  "extends": "@armirage/eslint-config-armirage",
  "rules": {}
}
```

There are several rules in the eslint:recommended ruleset that Armirage does set. Rules we feel are better handled on a case for case basis. You might want to enforce these rules in your project for a more complete implementation.

// .eslintrc.json
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "@armirage/eslint-config-armirage"
  ],
  "rules": {}
}
```

You can mix in other ESLint sharable configs, and extend them as well. The last ruleset in the array will have precedence.

## Options

You can also override individual rules. This can be helpful to apply rules per project. For instance I often use the following:

// .eslintrc.json
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "@armirage/eslint-config-armirage"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "prefer-destructuring": ["warn", {"object": true, "array": true}]
  }
}
```

This gives me the added coverage of the `eslint:recommended`, the Armirage conventions, and I get warnings when objects or arrays could be de-structured. Something that may be project, intent, maintainability dependent.

## How to Contribute

We need more modular rulesets. The base eslint ruleset is ECMAScript 2020. It should be easy to add other modular configs to the package to account for more environments.
